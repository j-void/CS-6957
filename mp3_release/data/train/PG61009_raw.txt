2. So the Teacher turned him out But still he lingered near, And waited patiently about Till Mary did appear; And then he ran to her and laid His head upon her arm As if he said "I'm not afraid, You'll keep me from all harm."
3. "What makes the lamb love Mary so?" The eager children cry, "O, Mary loves the lamb you know," The Teacher did reply; "And you each gentle animal In confidence may bind, And make them follow at your call If you are always kind."

2. Then the traveller in the dark Thanks you for your little spark, He could not see which way to go If you did not twinkle so. In the dark blue sky you keep, And often through my curtains peep, For you never shut your eye Till the sun is in the sky.

 [Illustration]
LITTLE BO-PEEP.
 [Music]
Little Bo-Peep has lost her sheep, And can't tell where to find them: Leave them alone, and they'll come home And bring their tails behind them.
2. Little Bo-Peep fell fast asleep And dreamt she heard them bleating. But when she awoke, she found it a joke. For they were still a-fleeting.
3. She took up her crook, intending to look, Determined for to find them; She found them indeed, but it made her heart bleed For they'd left their tails behind them.
4. She heaved a sigh, and wiped her eye And ran over hill and dale, O! And tried what she could, as a shepherdess should, To tack to each sheep its tail, O!

 [Illustration]
ORANGES AND LEMONS.

Frogs and snails and puppy dog's tails, And such are little boys made of.

3. What are our young men made of, made of? What are our young men made of? Sighs and leers, and crocodile tears, And such are our young men made of; Sighs and leers, and crocodile tears, And such are our young men made of.
4. What are young women made of, made of? What are young women made of? Ribbons and laces, and sweet pretty faces, And such are young women made of; Ribbons and laces, and sweet pretty faces, And such are young women made of.

 [Illustration]
THERE WAS A LITTLE MAN.
 [Music]
1. There was a little man, And he wooed a little maid, And he said "Little maid! will you wed, wed, wed? I have little more to say, Then will you? yea, or nay! For least said is soonest mended, ded, ded, ded!"
2. The little maid replied, (Some say a little sighed) But what shall we have to eat, eat, eat? Will the love that you're so rich in, Put a fire into the kitchen? Or the little God of Love turn the spit, spit, spit.
3. The little man replied, (Some say a little cried,) For his little heart was filled with sorrow, row; With the little that I have, I will be your little slave, And the rest my little dear we will borrow, row.
4. Thus did the little gent, Make the little maid relent, For her little heart began to beat, beat, beat; Through his offers were but small, She accepted of them all, Now she thanks her little stars for her fate, fate, fate.

 [Illustration]
LITTLE BOY BLUE.
 [Music]
Little Boy Blue, come blow your horn, The sheep's in the meadow, the cow's in the corn. Where's the boy that looks after the sheep? He's under the haycock fast asleep. Will you wake him? No, not I! For if I do, he'll be sure to cry.

 [Illustration]
POLLY PUT THE KETTLE ON.
 [Music]
Polly put the kettle on, Polly put the kettle on, Polly put the kettle on, We'll all have tea.
Sukey take it off again, Sukey take it off again, Sukey take it off again, They've all gone away.

 [Illustration]
HUSH-A-BY BABY.
 [Music]
Hush-a-by Baby on the tree-top, When the wind blows The cradle will rock; When the bough breaks The cradle will fall; Down comes baby, cradle and all!

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit 501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.
The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search facility: www.gutenberg.org.
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
